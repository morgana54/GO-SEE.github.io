                Shot in Japan and Poland, the documentary by Julia Kuzka is not only a coming of age story about a great adventure, but also about loneliness and other challenges that the models face every day.

Extremely intimate, sincere and often controversial statements, combined with snippets from the everyday life of the models, constitute a beautiful and honest picture of the fashion world.

                From the very beginning of our work on the film, our greatest goal has been to draw the attention of the general public to hitherto unknown aspects of the models' work. Many people working in the production, including the initiator and director Julia Kuzka, have many years of experience in the modeling industry, therefore producing and releasing "GO<span class="cormorant-font-italic see">&SEE</span>" is a personal mission for all us. We wish to show the true face of the models' work in order to confront common beliefs about this profession as easy, pleasant or prestigious at all times. We do not want to impose any filters on the material shown, in order to honestly reflect both the beautiful and daunting sides of modeling.
            </div>

            <div class="fourth__paragraph--bottom">
                It is our dream to create a kind of movement that will support all those who want to or already do work in the modeling industry. In particular, girls who are aspiring to start their adventure with modeling - often very young and unsupported by their parents. Furthermore, we want to reach out to beginner models as well as the experienced ones, that are daily confronted with incomprehension, loneliness and lack of self-apprehension.
            </div>

            <div class="fourth__paragraph--bottom">
                "GO<span class="cormorant-font-italic see">&SEE</span>" is created in an intimate atmosphere thanks to the work of motivated, creative and talented people, for whom this film reflects the personal need to give a voice to those who are never asked for their opinions.

                Long before you will get to see your face on the glossy magazine covers sold in street kiosks or the commercial banners for shique boutiques, You'll have to walk through countless castings, photo studios, make up schools and designer ateliers while also living your life through a handful of countries outside your native continent. Nobody said it’s gonna be easy - If you’re lucky you’ll earn some money after that second contract you had in Asia, which will help you wipe the tears of frustration and demotivation. You have to remember to be strong, self confident and patient. Don’t forget to smile, even when your 16 year-old contract-bound roommate from East Europe is driving you crazy. Clients don’t like pout models, right? Probably you won’t even get this job you so long awaited cause of another 16 year old girl from east Europe - she's been in the business, at least, two years longer than you - her portfolio is bigger and her hips are smaller. Just don’t give up, cause, eventually, someone might give you a chance. At that point, all you have to do is strike a pose.

                I started working on <span class="cormorant-font-italic">Strike a Pose</span> project in August 2018 during my first model trip to Seoul. Since that time I’ve been staying in China, Japan and Europe, photographing life of models on the contract abroad. For 2 years I took hundreds of moments from the backstage of, looking like luxurious, fashion industry. 
                As in my every project I’m focus on autobiographical context which is showed by people surrounding me. In the same time I'm letting my viewers look behind the curtain, open another closet. I'm showing the world of expensive brands from the undergrund, step further than instagram- there nobody wants to share that your fancy models apartment is not fancy at all. <span class="cormorant-font-italic">Strike a Pose</span> project is on going.
